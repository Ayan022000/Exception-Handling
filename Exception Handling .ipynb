    "Attempting to open a file that does not exist\n",
    "\n",
    "Running out of memory\n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions can be handled by using try and except statements. The try block contains the code that might raise an exception, and the except block contains the code that is executed if an exception is raised. If an exception is not caught, the program will terminate with an error message.\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax errors, on the other hand, are errors that occur when the Python interpreter cannot understand the code that has been written. They are caused by mistakes in the syntax of the code, such as:\n",
